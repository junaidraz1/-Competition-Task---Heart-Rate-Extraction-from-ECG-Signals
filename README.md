# -Competition-Task---Heart-Rate-Extraction-from-ECG-Signals
The goal of this is to extract heart rate (HR) values from ECG signals using methods I have learned during of the course that I took which is Analytics for Health Wearables. The task was to implement a heart rate extraction function that minimizes the mean absolute error (MAE) when compared to the provided ground truth HR values.
